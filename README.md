Some LED patterns for Arduino and RoboRio

***The code is separated into three directories:***

***- Arduino***

Here is the code designed to be run on a simple LED strip with an arduino
  
***- RobotJava***

And here is the code designed to be run on a RoboRio with a simple LED strip

***- ArduinoXRobotJava***

The code that uses a RoboRio to communicate with an Arduino (which controls the LEDs)
